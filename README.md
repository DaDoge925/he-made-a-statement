# he-made-a-statement
"He made a statement" Dog image collection

Images are either jpeg or png depending on how i saved it haha

- File names is structured as "Cause [Group] Effect.ext" `// .ext is extension referring to .png/jpg`
  - Cause: the main descriptive word (adjective)
  - Group: a group noun if present in the phrase (e.g "opps"). Omitted from the filename when the phrase is 'gang' (see examples)
  - Effect: the outcome or action word from the phrase
  - there should be no spaces on each (an cause/effect like "applauded and killed" should be written as "applaudedandkilled")

ex. 
- "He made a statement so **Jolly** even his __gang__ **gifted** him
  - This gets the file name `Jolly Gifted.jpg`
  - group word is omitted when the word is "gang"
- "He made a statement so **peak** even his **opps** **fucked** him
  - This gets the file name `Peak Opps fucked.jpg`
